## Overview

### The challenge

User should be able to:

Enter prompts given by Wordle.com into a website which returns the possible solutions. 


## My process

Here's my process so far

 - save satabase as array
 - filter our any word from the database which does not have a specific letter at a specific integer (green letter)
 - take top word (most likely to be correct becausue of how website chooses the word for the day) and print it
 - print remaining results.
 
### Built with

- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

This is my first 'ground-up' project using Javascript, HTML and CSS.


### Continued development

- Add user interface which takes users letters and gives them the possible words.
- Add 'cheat' function which reveals the answer for the day.
